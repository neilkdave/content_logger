Project Outline:

Project Need:
The goal is to to create an app, starting on PC and eventually synchronizing with
phone to manually log all books, movies, video games etc. that I have ever watched 
and be able to add to list dynamically as I remember them or consume new content. 
I would like to create a searchable gui that pulls info from internet to add
categories such as year made, director, genre etc. for each entry. I also have a 
ton of movie reviews and would like to ultimately add a hook to the code to 
integrate them and remind me that I've ALREADY written a review, for a movie
if I try to do so again (because I have made that mistake before with my 
disorganization).

Notes:
Will try to make code for core app as generic as possible to any user can use
GUI for their own personalized "GoodReads" style logging for anything the user 
would like to log i.e. Beer, books, collectibles, travel, Beer.

Milestones:
1. Write script to update and save document for initial category (movies) based on user input 
2. Add useful sort, erase, and modify commands
3. Allow script to find and simultaneously update multiple category files
4. Allow user to manually add subcategories (date, director, genre etc.) and manually fill out each entry
5. Automatically pull review files (I need this) stored in directory and associate with each entry
6. Create PC GUI to make running script more streamlined
7. Create Mobile App that does same thing
8. Sync category files and entries between mobile app and PC.
9. Pull entries for subcategories from internet using each title ex) Enter->The Matrix, Autopopulate->Director: The Wachowskis, Year: 1999
